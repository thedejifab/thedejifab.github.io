In trying to find a topic for my next post, the first thought was to explore theories surrounding the &amp;ldquo;information loss during translation&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;ldquo;Could this loss be because Yoruba is a heavily diacritical language and many modern Yoruba speakers/writers are not big on diacritics?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Is less information lost if there&amp;rsquo;s a significantly greater proportion of one language over the other in code-switched expressions?</description></item><item><title>Why I'm doing this</title><link>https://thedejifab.github.io/blog/why-doing-this/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 21:54:47 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://thedejifab.github.io/blog/why-doing-this/</guid><description>In the final months of 2021, in search of a final year undergraduate thesis topic, especially one that would enable me to make a foray into the area of Natural Language Processing, I stumbled upon the concept of code-switching while reading Dan Jurafsky&amp;rsquo;s Speech and Language processing.
Code-switching involves mixing two or more languages within an expression. At the simplest level, code-switching is what happens when a Nigerian says &amp;ldquo;bawo ni, what will you eat?</description></item></channel></rss>
