In trying to find a topic for my next post, the first thought was to explore theories surrounding the &ldquo;information loss during translation&rdquo;.</p><p>Could this loss be because Yoruba is a heavily diacritical language and many modern Yoruba speakers/writers are not big on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">diacritics</a>? "
or &ldquo;Is less information lost if there&rsquo;s a significantly greater proportion of one language over the other in code-switched expressions?&rdquo;. I wish this post provided elaborate answers to those questions, but it doesn&rsquo;t because I don&rsquo;t have the answers <em>yet</em>.
Instead, I&rsquo;m keeping it simple and writing about a newly encountered concept of lexical borrowing and how it compares to code switching.</p><p>Lexical borrowing is a concept that&rsquo;s similar to code switching in some ways and different in others. It is the process of <em>adopting</em> one or more words from one language&rsquo;s vocabulary into another&rsquo;s. To put things in perspective, lexical borrowing is how words like &ldquo;tea&rdquo; with a Chinese origin and &ldquo;cybercafe&rdquo; with a French origin have found their way into everyday Yoruba expressions.</p><p>Lexical borrowing happens at the individual word level and is primarily caused by the inability to translate a word into a given language, forcing the speaker to borrow the language as-is from its originating language.</p><p>For example, when a Yoruba speaker says &ldquo;Jide wa ni kindergarten&rdquo; (read &lsquo;Jide is in kindergarten&rsquo; in English), what they do in essence is to borrow the word Kindergarten from the German vocabulary because there&rsquo;s practically no word in the Yoruba vocabulary that describes the first year of formal education.</p><p>On the other hand, code switching happens at the sentence level and is caused by different reasons including; the need to fit in, assert persuasion, communicate in secret, and express a different kind of emotion. For example, a Yoruba speaker might use a code-switched Yoruba-English sentence &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking with you, <em>je ki ori e pe</em>&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking with you, <em>warn yourself</em>&rdquo; because to a Yoruba audience, the former is liable to carry more weight and convey more seriousness than the latter.</p><p>Lastly, it is important to note that in lexical borrowing, there are wealth dynamics between the languages involved. More words come from one language than the other, with the former usually being a wealthier language in terms of constructs, words, experiences, and expressions. This is very evident in the form of lexical borrowing that happens between the Yoruba and English languages.</p><p>Best believe I&rsquo;ll come back to the theories and questions I spoke about earlier, but <em>I do not know when</em> :)</p></article><div class=pagination><a class=pagination__item href=https://dejifabusuyi.com/blog/why-doing-this/><span class=pagination__label>Previous Post</span>
